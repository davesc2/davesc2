- 👋 Hi, I’m @davesc2
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic coding in arduino but also dipping my toes into python. I've gone through the inventr.io 30 days lost in space and adventure kit 2 and have gone through several other small projects from books, websites, etc, and have been exploring
examples while trying to complete my first actual project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't know how or what I can contribute given my profound lack of knowledge and experience in this area but if I can, I will.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- Currently working on a project to vent/cool the A/V cabinet for our living room. Using an Adafruit metro mini controller, adafruit mini relay to power a couple small fans driven by an adafruit pct2075 temp sensor, a sparkfun servo controller to open teh cabinet door a couple inches for venting and a reed switch to check the state of the cabinet door since no venting is required if the door is already open. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: adhd is my super power, greatest weakness and the reason I have 5 different hobbies all in various states of non-completion.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @davesc2
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic coding in arduino but also dipping my toes into python. I've gone through the inventr.io 30 days lost in space and adventure kit 2 and have gone through several other small projects from books, websites, etc, and have been exploring
examples while trying to complete my first actual project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't know how or what I can contribute given my profound lack of knowledge and experience in this area but if I can, I will.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

- ⚡ Fun fact: adhd is both my superpower and greatest weakness.
